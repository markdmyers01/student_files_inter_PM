    This example should be run two ways: 1) with the acquire()/release() commented out,  2) with them uncommented

    When the lock not used, each thread comes through the function, sets the internal_message which then sets
    the global message, therefore the last thread to pass through the line message = internal_message.

    When the lock is used, each thread must wait at the acquire().  One thread at a time is allowed passed acquire()
    and it gets the global message, assigns it to internal_message, appends its own message to internal_message,
    then sets the global one to the internal_message variable.  No other threads will interfere now.  After the
    release(), the next thread is allowed to repeat this process.
