      city_search.py   -   Refactored task2_3.py solution,
                           used with task3_1.py

      This module reads data from cities15000.txt, collects the name, population,
      elevation, and country code into a namedtuple.

      It provides a highest() and largest() function for calculating each of those.
      Finally, it allows for searching city names.
