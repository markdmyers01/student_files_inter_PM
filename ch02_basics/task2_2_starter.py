      task2_2_starter.py   -   Python Basics Overview

      Reads data from resources/cities15000.txt (a tsv file).
      Determines the largest city and highest city.
      Allows for searching by city names to determine a city population.


      Helpful hints:
      1. To find the largest city, sort the cities data structure by population.  The first element in the
         list should be the largest city (a City NamedTuple).

          Tip: As an example of sorting, the following would sort by country:
                key=lambda city: city.country

      2. Repeat step 1, this time sorting by elevation instead of population.
